## Uncompleted Issues and why

* Starting and ending the timer

These tasks are uncompleted because we had a hard time connecting golang and angular. Also, we need to set up a database for the login and to add and remove tasks from a list. There are also some components we need to learn how to use so we can create a login section and a display for the tasks.
