# Project Name: Mafia
# Project Description: Our website will model the card game, Mafia. It is a game with 6-8 players in a village and one of them is a secret killer. The players must figure out who is the secret killer before everyone dies. Our functionality will include dealing the cards, a chat box to discuss after each round, a voting system, and stats on the side.
