# Backend Server
## How to run server:
### Choose Angular Handler 
Backend: Use angular_embedded <br>
Frontend: Use angular_live <br>
One should be in src and the other in server folder. Swap them so the relevent handler is in server folder <br>

### Build
run "go build" in command line (make sure you are in the server folder) <br>

### Run .exe
run pomodoro_planner.exe <br>

### Server should be running!
