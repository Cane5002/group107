# Backend Server
## How to run server:
### Choose Angular Handler 
Backend: Use angular_embedded.go <br>
Frontend: Use angular_live.go <br>
One of the two above files will be located in the src folder (outside the server folder) and the other inside the server folder. Drag the desired file into the server folder and the other into the src folder.  <br>
Basically you should only have one of the two files inside the server folder at a time <br>

### Build (First time running after a pull or after every server code update)
navigate the terminal to .\src\server <br>
run "go build" in command line (make sure you are in the server folder) <br>

### Run .exe
run pomodoro_planner.exe <br>

### Server should be running!
